# IEEE-754-32bit-Floating-Point-Unit
The project focused on designing a specialized Floating-Point Unit capable of handling IEEE 754 format for 32-bit numbers, enabling precise addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations on floating-point data.
Integration of this dedicated unit into a MIPS processor extended the processor's functionality, allowing it to seamlessly operate on Floating Point numbers and significantly enhancing its versatility in handling numerical computations.
